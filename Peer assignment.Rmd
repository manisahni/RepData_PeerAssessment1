# Preprocessing files and the dataset

Read in the data from the activity file

```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ',', colClasses = c("numeric", "character","integer"))
```


Load in the libraries being used.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

Change date into dateformat using as.Date
```{r}
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
```


```{r}
head(data)
```


# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Aggregate the number of steps in a day by date, using group_by
```{r}
steps <- data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE)) 
steps

```

Use ggplot for making the histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")
```
